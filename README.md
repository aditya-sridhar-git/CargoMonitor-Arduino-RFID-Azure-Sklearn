# CargoMonitor-Arduino-RFID-Azure-Sklearn
An IoT-Based Cargo Condition Monitoring and Package Identification System Using RFID and Predictive Analytics

# SmartCargoMonitor

An IoT-based real-time cargo monitoring and package identification system using RFID, environmental sensors, and predictive analytics.

## 🚚 Project Overview

This system enables:
- **RFID-based package identification** — Each package has an RFID tag containing its details.
- **Sensor-based cargo monitoring** — Common sensors track overall cargo conditions (temperature, humidity, gas, vibration).
- **Cloud connectivity** — Data is transmitted via ESP32 to a cloud platform (e.g., Blynk or Firebase) for real-time access.
- **Predictive AI models** — Built using scikit-learn to forecast potential cargo damage and provide early warnings.
- **Alert mechanisms** — Trigger buzzer/cloud alerts if unsafe conditions (like gas leaks or shocks) are detected.

## 🔧 Tech Stack

- **Microcontroller**: Arduino+ESP32 (Wi-Fi-enabled)
- **Modules**: RC522 RFID Reader, NEO-6M GPS, DHT11/22, MQ-series gas sensor, SW-420 vibration sensor
- **Software**: Arduino IDE, Python (for AI models), scikit-learn
- **Cloud Platforms**: Blynk / Firebase / ThingSpeak (configurable)

## 📦 Features

- RFID scans to retrieve live package info
- Real-time sensor data uploads to cloud
- Visual dashboards and notification alerts
- AI-based insights and fault prediction
- Modular, low-cost, and scalable design
